# REALMeditor
Development for REALMeditor, a Unity Game Engine tool to help manage and create reusable game assets.
<BR><BR>
REALMeditor is a tool that can help create prefabs and assets based on the UI options you created using MODULEditor.<BR>
<BR>
MODULEditor is a sub editor for the creation of REALMeditor's UI and developer options. REALMeditor then loads your created modules and displays them in an organized fashion.
<BR><BR>
An example would be creating an NPC maker within REALMeditor, this can be achieved by creating the Module for the NPC maker using MODULEditor.<BR>
<BR>
This is a slow work in progress to implement more functionality and expand on the methods used to generate the C# scripts. Currently, REALMeditor is able to save prefabs in a defined folder, as well as create C# scripts based off the current loaded module's developer options that are chosen.

<BR><BR>
Lets say you want to create an NPC Maker module, you can define the elements in your module using MODULEditor's interface and attach logic scripts to those options. When viewing your NPC maker in REALMeditor you will have a button to save the prefab and generate the attached script.

Included are both REALMeditor and MODULEditor for the creation of a customizable RPG/MMO creation tool created by developers, for developers.
